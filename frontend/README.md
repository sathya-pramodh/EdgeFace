# Live Face Detection - Frontend

**Live Face Detection** is a React-based web application for face-liveness verification. This project involves recording video using the webcam and verifying user liveness through action prompts.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration**: Captures video from the user's webcam.
- **Action Prompts**: Provides random action prompts to verify liveness.
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays countdowns for each action prompt.
- **Recording Control**: Allows starting and stopping video recording.
- **Backend Interaction**: Sends recorded video to a backend server for processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the Vite development server and opens the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. **Start Recording**:
   - Click the "Start Recording" button to begin recording video. 
   - Follow the prompts displayed on the screen and complete the actions within the countdown time.

2. **Stop Recording**:
