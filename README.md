# Real-Time Face Liveness Detection

This project implements a browser-based face liveness detection system using machine learning models. The system is designed to detect whether the face presented in the camera feed is live or a spoof (e.g., photo, video).

## Features
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Captures live video from the user's camera.
- **ML-Based Liveness Detection**: Uses a machine learning model to detect face liveness in real-time.
- **Browser-Compatible**: Works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) using TensorFlow.js or ONNX.js.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/sathya-pramodh/LiveFace.git]
   cd face-liveness-detection
